## Introduction to PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its robustness, reliability, and extensibility. It supports SQL (Structured Query Language) and offers various advanced features like transactions, triggers, and stored procedures.

## Setting Up PostgreSQL

Before diving into CRUD operations and relational joins, you need to set up PostgreSQL on your system. Follow these steps:

1. **Download PostgreSQL:** Visit the official PostgreSQL website and download the appropriate version for your operating system.
2. **Install PostgreSQL:** Run the installer and follow the installation instructions. Make sure to note down the username, password, and port number used during the installation process.
3. **Start PostgreSQL Server:** Once installed, start the PostgreSQL server using the provided commands or through the system's services.

## Basic CRUD Operations

CRUD operations are fundamental in database management. Here's how you can perform CRUD operations using PostgreSQL:

- **Create:** Use INSERT statements to add new records to a table.
- **Read:** Retrieve data from a table using SELECT statements.
- **Update:** Modify existing records using UPDATE statements.
- **Delete:** Remove records from a table using DELETE statements.

Here's a simple example of CRUD operations:

```sql
-- Create
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');

-- Read
SELECT * FROM users;

-- Update
UPDATE users SET email = 'johndoe@example.com' WHERE id = 1;

-- Delete
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```
